<section><h2>Common questions</h2>
<h3>What is an AZA accredited zoo?</h3>
<p>Basically what being an AZA accredited zoo mean is that the zoo has agreed to conduct themselves a certain way. They also have agreed to help educate the public, and help conservation efforts, among other things. An AZA accredited zoo also has access to information from other AZA accredited zoos. Information can range from why did you choose to set up your lion enclosure that way, to what is your polar bears favorite treat. This network of peers can prove to be extremely helpful. To learn more about AZA accreditation visit the <a href="https://www.aza.org/accreditation/">AZA webpage.</a></p>
<h3>Who are zookeepers?</h3>
<p>Zookeepers are professionals who have at least a bachelors in an animal related field. Their job is to take care of the animals. This ranges from cleaning the enclosures to making their diets. One of the more fun aspects of the job is enrichment. This is something that changes up the animals day and helps keep them active. Keepers are generally in charge of choosing enrichment for the animal which can range from a new scent to a new toy with treats hidden inside. </p>  </section>
<aside><h1>Goals for the webpage</h1>
<p>The goal of this webpage is to inform people on zoo news and new zoo babies. Personally, I feel that zoo's are sometimes looked down upon because they are open to the public and are therefore sometimes viewed as not scientific, or they seem to be looked down on because they have captive animals. I hope that this site helps to relieve any possible misgivings people have on zoos and helps to inform people on current zoo activites.</p>
<p>One really great way for a person to learn about animals is to go to a zoo. They are full of animals and keepers who are more than willing to stop and talk to you about any questions you have. Zoos now-a-days help educate the public in many ways. Most zoos will have scheduled programs, like an animal feeding or training that a keeper will be doing. Generally during these activities the keeper or another keeper will talk to the public and explain a little about what is going on and a little about the animal.</p>
<p>Choosing a zoo to go to can also be a struggle. One thing that I always look for in a zoo is an AZA accreditation, because becoming AZA accreditated is a fairly difficult process and zoos who are can be seen as good zoos. Now this doesn't mean that zoos that aren't AZA accreditated are bad, but I would be more cautious and try to find out why they aren't.</p></aside>
