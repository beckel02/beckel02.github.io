<h2>A new elephant exhibit</h2>
<p>September 29, 2014</p>
<p>Wichita, Kansas is getting a new elephant exhibit! Shortly after the announcement of a new elephant exhibit the Sedgwick County Zoo announced that the exhibit will feature a boat ride. This is very big news as it will be the first elephant exhibit with a boat ride where vistors will be in the water with the elephants. For the safety of not only the people but also the elephants it can be gathered that there will be precautions set up to ensure safety all around.This new exhibit will give the resident elephants a larger enclosure making it one of the largest in the nation! Along with the new exhibit the zoo is planning on bringing in more elephants. Elephants are very social creatures, so having more than just their current 2 will help with the health of all the elephants involved.</p>
