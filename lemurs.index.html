<h2> Baby ring tailed lemurs </h2>
<p> As a child I grew up watching this amazing show called <a href="http://pbskids.org/zoboo/"> Zaboomafoo</a> this was a show about brothers who helped out animals in need with the assistance of a ring-tailed lemur named Zaboo.</p>

<p> These are two of the four baby lemurs that were born at the <a href="http://www.lszooduluth.org/"> Lake Superior Zoo</a> this past summer (2014). I would highly recomend going to see them as they are very playful. </p>
<p> For the first week after being born ring-tailed lemurs stay on their mothers stomach. As they get older they branch out a little and can be seen on the mothers back and then eventually exploring on their own. </p>
